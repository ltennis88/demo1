Consumer,Resolving Issues,How to make a complaint,"We take great pride in the products and services we offer both trades and consumers.  However, we understand that sometimes issues arise, and we’re here to help if they do. 

We value all feedback - as it helps us improve your experience. So, whether you’re a trade or consumer and you need to make a complaint, here’s what you need to know: 

How to make a complaint
Online using the Complaint Form at the bottom of this page 

Write to us at: Checkatrade, Focus Point, 21 Caledonian Road, London, N1 9GB 

Call us on: 0333 014 6190 

Information for consumers making a complaint
Tradespeople on Checkatrade are expected to handle complaints professionally and responsibly – and we recommend you contact them directly to try and resolve your issue first. Our How to resolve an issue with a trade guide could help with this. 

If you're unable to resolve the issue directly with the tradesperson, please contact us using the ‘How to make a complaint’ section above and we’ll look into it.  

We can’t force a trade to act, but we can investigate and decide whether they continue to meet our standards for remaining on our platform. All complaints are reviewed in line with our complaints handling procedure – depending on the seriousness of the complaint. We may contact both the trade and consumer to request supporting evidence such as quotes, invoices, proof of payment and photos to assess the trade's compliance with our standards. We could then: 

Provide guidance to trades. 

Restrict or, in serious cases, remove them from Checkatrade according to our Deactivation and Sanctions Policy. 

Limit the trade’s activity on our platform during the investigation.   

As a platform, we don’t get directly involved in resolving disputes between trades and consumers, and we don’t offer a formal mediation or dispute resolution service. Instead, we believe the best outcomes come from open, honest, and respectful communication between both parties. We encourage consumers and trades to talk to each other directly, giving each side the chance to explain, clarify, or resolve any misunderstandings. In our experience, most issues can be worked out when both parties are willing to listen and engage constructively. While we’re not here to take sides, we do believe in fostering a fair and balanced space where everyone’s voice can be heard — and that starts with open conversation. 

Further support
If the trade you’ve contacted is not responding, or your issue remains unresolved, you could look at the following options: 

Consider leaving a review of the trade that follows our guidelines to share your experience with other consumers. 

Speak to the Citizens Advice Consumer Helpline on 0808 223 1133 or visit citizensadvice.org.uk and they can support with free legal advice. 

Contact your bank or insurance provider to see if they can support you with retrieving funds in the event of fraud or faulty work. 

Report a trade to Trading Standards if you believe a trade has broken the law or acted unfairly. Trading Standards work in partnership with Citizens Advice – and they aim to investigate unfair or illegal business activity and stop them operating. 

Report them to or contact their governing body or provider of accreditation service – such as Gas Safe or NAPIT.   

Make a claim on their Public Liability Insurance if you think this may be an option available to you – we can help you with those details or you can request them from the tradesperson directly. 

Report them to the police. Bad practice may mean fraud or theft, so it's worth reporting this if you believe they have acted illegally or you’re feeling unsafe. For more details on fraud, visit Action Fraud.  

Consider Making a Money Claim online via HM Courts & Tribunals Service for small claims.  

Contact your bank or insurance provider to see if they can support you with retrieving funds in the event of fraud or faulty work. 

If you need urgent help, contact the Financial Ombudsman Service. They can support if you’re vulnerable or in with financial difficulty. "

Tradesperson,Jobs,Will this Drone Survey service take jobs away from me?,"No! In fact, this service is designed to generate more work for you.

Homeowners often avoid roof inspections due to cost or inconvenience. Our affordable and easy-to-access service means more homeowners will become aware of potential issues and will be directed to Checkatrade members like you for repairs.

Homeowners will be immediately connected to local roofers through Checkatrade if their report identifies issues.

More informed customers = better quality leads. Since homeowners will have a report in hand, they will have a clearer understanding of what needs to be done when they approach you. "
Tradesperson,Jobs,Will you promote the Drone Survey partnership more than my listing?,"
No. Your Checkatrade listing will still be displayed as usual and receive the same level of exposure. The Drone Survey service is designed to complement, not replace, traditional roofing work."

"
Tradesperson,Jobs,How can I use the Checkatrade Drone Survey to my advantage?,"If a homeowner is unsure about your recommendations, you can suggest a low-cost drone roof survey from £99 to provide independent verification. This can help build trust and increase the likelihood of securing work.

Relevant information from the get-go! 

Make sure your response includes all relevant details that the customer needs, such as an estimated timeline, costs where appropriate, your availability and any additional information. This helps the customer make an informed decision and reduces the need for follow-up questions. 

 

Give a reason to respond 

Offer something of value to encourage a prompt reply, such as a free consultation or estimate.

Tradesperson,Payments,Checkatrade Pay Registration Tips,"Watch our step-by-step walkthrough videos to setup Checkatrade Pay:

Limited Company 
Sole Trader 
 

Intro

When you set up for Checkatrade Pay, which allows you to send payment requests directly to customers through the Checkatrade app, we need to gather some information about you and your business (or just you if you’re a sole trader) to complete the Checkatrade Pay setup. Part of this process is facilitated by our third-party payment platform, Adyen. 

As part of Checkatrade Pay set up, we require information such as proof of identity, bank account information to process disbursements to you and incorporation documents if you’re a limited company. This help guide provides information on where to find these documents and the types that are accepted. 

You must ensure that you enter information carefully, and that your information matches exactly with the official documents you upload (such as passport and banking information). 

If we need more information, we will contact you by email or within your Checkatrade account. In this case, verification can take longer. Check your emails regularly.
